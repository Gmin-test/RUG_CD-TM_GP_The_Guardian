Brazil’s left went into Sunday’s election hoping for an outright majority for their candidate Lula over Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right figure who has been Brazil’s president for the last four years. At the very least, they hoped for a commanding margin and a sense of momentum going into a run-off between the two. And progressives around the world were watching for an emphatic repudiation of Bolsonaro’s presidency that would signal that the forces of extremism were in retreat. But it hasn’t worked out that way. Instead, Lula won 48% of votes, roughly in line with polls – but Bolsonaro did much better than expected, taking 43%, and his supporters also outperformed polls in state and senate races. Lula is expected to take most votes from the minor candidates who now drop out, and should be favourite to win in the second round on October 30 - but the road to victory looks rockier than it did last night. The stakes could hardly be higher. So what just happened? And why does the result matter so much, for Brazil and for the world? Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips, will explain it. Here are the headlines. PS One other big story just breaking as I send this – the Sun and the BBC are reporting that ahead of his speech at Conservative party conference today, chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is about to announce a U-turn on the controversial scrapping of the 45p top rate of tax. The Guardian hasn’t confirmed that yet, but Kwarteng is due to be on Radio 4’s Today programme at 8.10am - so it may be worth tuning in. And Politics Live is up and running early. Five big stories Politics | Liz Truss is struggling to persuade Conservative MPs to back her controversial mini-budget, with some even threatening all-out rebellion amid fears that they will once again become known as the “nasty party”. On Sunday Truss refused to rule out public spending cuts and a real-terms drop in benefits to help pay for the mini-budget in a BBC interview. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Coronavirus | More than a third of young people feel their life is spiralling out of control, according to findings released to the Guardian ahead of a nationwide campaign that highlights Covid’s impact on the younger generation. One in three said they think their job prospects will never recover from the pandemic. Politics | Dominic Johnson, a City financier who is also Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business partner, has been given a peerage and a senior ministerial role in Liz Truss’s government. The controversial move comes amid growing questions over cabinet ministers’ close relationships with the City. Immigration | The home secretary, Suella Braverman, has said that the UK has too many low skilled migrants. In the same interview Braverman restated that she has every intention of enforcing Boris Johnson’s plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. In depth: ‘It’s massively dispiriting for the left’\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva – widely known as Lula – is the charismatic leader of the PT (Workers’ Party), the dominant left-of-centre force in Brazilian politics. His presidency from 2003-2010 is remembered by many in the country as an era of economic growth and declining inequality. In 2018, when he was unable to run because of a corruption conviction that has since been overturned, the far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro came to power. Backed by Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán, Bolsonaro has arguably been as cartoonishly incompetent and malevolent a figure as either – presiding over the devastation of the Amazon, massive increases in poverty, and the deaths of more than 685,000 Brazilians from coronavirus. “The mood among his opponents had been one of cautious optimism,” said Tom. “It’s been quite emotional for them – the idea that Bolsonaro’s presidency could be over, or nearly over. It’s been a long slog. They feel that so much damage has been done.” *** What happened yesterday? The catharsis that Lula’s supporters had hoped for failed to materialise. “It’s massively dispiriting for the left,” said Tom. “And really surprising - not in terms of Lula’s vote, which is in line with what everyone thought, but in terms of Bolsonaro’s, which is significantly higher. The pollsters got that badly wrong. I went to Lula’s rally, and people were crying, or in a state of shock.” That mood of disappointment for the left was heightened by victory for Bolsonaro’s allies in 19 of the 27 available Senate seats, as well as a strong showing in the lower house. Bolsonaro’s former environment minister, who presided over huge increases in deforestation, won his congressional election; so did Eduardo Pazzuelo, the health minister who oversaw Brazil’s catastrophic handling of coronavirus at the height of the pandemic. “Nearly 700,000 people died here, and his management of Covid was demonstrably incompetent,” Tom said. “But that doesn’t seem to have impacted his support.”\n*** What kind of a campaign has it been? “It’s been pretty toxic,” Tom said. “I first covered an election here in 2006, and I’ve never seen this level of bitterness before. Bolsonaro treats elections as wars. A lot of people on the left have been frightened – one Lula supporter said to me on Saturday that it’s the first time in my life I’ve been scared to put a sticker on my car.” Those fears are not idle: a Lula supporter was brutally murdered by a Bolsonaro supporter last month, one of a string of violent attacks by supporters of a candidate who has demanded leftists “be eradicated from public life”. And the murders in June of Guardian contributor Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira have also come at a time when Bolsonaro has made relentless verbal attacks on advocates for the rainforest. Lula has sought to frame his campaign as the strongest possible contrast with that of Bolsonaro, and his message of unity is just one of the ways the race has echoed the Trump-Biden contest in the US of 2020. On Sunday, he told reporters: “We want no more hatred, no more quarrelling, we want a country that lives in peace.” *** How important is this election for Brazil? The vote comes against a backdrop of terrible damage during Bolsonaro’s presidency, as this piece from Tom yesterday made clear. Bolsonaro’s authoritarian tendencies and contempt for any obligation to protect the worst-off have left Brazil facing a cost-of-living crisis and a lurch to the right on social issues. While Bolsonaro authorised a welfare package worth billions of dollars during the campaign, he has also promised to privatise the state-owned oil company, pass pro-gun legislation, cut corporation taxes, and toughen restrictions on abortion. One voter told Tom: “So many of the advances that took decades to achieve have been destroyed over the last four years.” *** What does it mean for the Amazon? Under Bolsonaro’s presidency, the destruction of Brazil’s rainforest reached a record high in the first half of this year; Lula has promised to put a stop to the deforestation. That is of global importance given the Amazon’s role as a store for carbon dioxide. Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor, wrote on Friday that almost a million hectares of the Amazon have been burned in the last year, with fires at their highest level in a decade. “Bolsonaro has dragged Brazil back to the wild west days we thought we’d left behind,” one expert told him. “It’s no exaggeration, then, to say that the Amazon’s fate rests on the outcome of our election.” While the identity of the next president remains crucial, last night’s results appear to be bad news for advocates for the rainforest whatever happens. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor and former Latin America correspondent, noted on Twitter that congressional success for Bolsonaro’s supporters will make it hard for Lula to pass Amazon protection legislation even if he wins. *** Was this result a repudiation of Bolsonaro? Lula has drawn support from a broad coalition of voters. “A lot of the people who’ve voted for him are not leftists,” said Tom. “People in the centre and on the centre right viewed this as an emergency election. They want a hard stop to this period, and hopefully next time a normal election with normal candidates.” That looks further away now. Cas Mudde, a leading expert on populism and the radical right, wrote in a sobering thread on Twitter last night that the result was the “worst possible Lula victory”, and that while he still expects Lula to prevail, the margin is likely to be small - or could be reversed if anything unexpected happens that favours Bolsonaro in the next few weeks. Comparing the prospect of a Bolsonaro defeat to Donald Trump’s in the US, he said that both men would have lost “very narrowly, and mostly because of a freak cause (the pandemic) … moreover, based on US experience, expect the right to further radicalise rather than moderate. And to be very competitive again in four years.” *** What happens next? Bolsonaro has long been planting the seeds of election denialism: “He’s been paving the way for the ‘big lie’ for years,” Tom said. In July, as one example, he made baseless claims that Brazil’s electronic voting system was vulnerable to subversion. The fact that the result now looks likely to be narrower than expected even if Lula wins “significantly increases the credibility of [the] “stolen elections” narrative among Bolsonaro supporters and thus the possibility of post-electoral violence,” Mudde wrote. Many in Brazil are fearful that Bolsonaro may stoke an anti-democratic mood among his supporters – though, perhaps scenting the possibility of a revival, he was noticeably quieter on his baseless fraud claims last night than he has recently been. “I don’t think we quite know what happens now,” Tom said. “If he does lose, there are people who fear a January 6 style assault on government institutions. And the most radical of his supporters are in many cases armed.” It’s worth emphasising that Lula remains the favourite – and that while Bolsonaro did better than expected, he is still the first sitting Brazilian president to go into a second round running behind since the 1980s. But after a deflating night for progressives, predictions about what might happen after a Lula victory risk being premature. “If people thought Bolsonaro and Bolsonarism were down and out they were wrong,” Tom said. “The far right is absolutely here to stay.” What else we’ve been reading In this fascinating interview Laurie Clark speaks with law professor Danielle Citron, who compellingly argues why privacy is a central part of human existence. “If you don’t have the ability to set boundaries around those aspects of intimate privacy, it’s hard to develop who you are,” Citron says.

Second homeowners and property investors have sent prices soaring, forcing people to move elsewhere. To combat this, the Welsh government has announced a raft of measures to stop communities in Welsh-speaking heartlands from being hollowed out. The measures will come into effect next year and they include: raising discretionary council tax premiums for second homes by 300%, a licensing scheme for holiday homes, and ensuring that second homeowners do not avoid these tax increases by tightening the rules and closing loopholes. Mabon ap Gwynfor, the housing spokesperson for Plaid Cymru in the Senedd, has a vision for villages in Wales to be “a place where local people have the right to live and where visitors can come and hear the Welsh language spoken by everyone from babes to the elderly.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

Iranians abroad, including some who are only away from their homeland temporarily to study or work, have been trying to stay in touch with their families at home, as well as convey what the street protests in Iran mean to them. Due to the threat of reprisals to their families in Iran, they fear putting their names to their views, but at the same time are eager to convey what is happening, and what they believe is at stake. This is an interview with a group of Iranian students in a city in Italy based on interviews with friends and family inside Iran. Their identities are known to the Guardian. Sadaf B “The insurrection stands for unity, freedom and equality. Just as when a dam explodes because of too much water getting reserved behind it, Iranian people have reached their limit. So they are mobilised and fight for their rightful demands. They have made themselves completely clear: they do not want to be ruled by this shameful regime and that they want a secular political system so that religious dictatorship can never happen in Iran again. So all the people, even the ones that are not on the streets, are contributing to this revolution, such as online activities, informing people and opening their doors to the wounded and the protesters who are escaping from armed forces.” Zahra H “In the 43 years of the Islamic Republic, there has been massive discrimination. Women are not allowed to exit the country without the permission of their father or husband. There have been cases that they have been killed by their father, brother or husband just to keep what they call ‘honour’. Minorities of any kind including religious, sexual orientations, other ethnicities and immigrants, never got the equal chance in any field comparing to others.”\nSadaf B “The one and only thing that matters in a person’s life is freedom. Restraining laws which are all based on Islamic rules has led to a full dictatorship for those who do not want to live by religious rules, which is basically almost everybody. For instance, even going out on a date is illegal in Iran, actually it’s a crime to hold hands with your partner in public if you are not married. If you are a woman, you are not able to wear what you want or sing or ride a bike! Drinking is completely illegal and arts are dramatically censored.” Mojtaba B “Our access to the truth is limited. Twitter and YouTube have been filtered for almost 15 years or they filtered Telegram after protests back in 2017. In this age of technology which every country is progressing through social media, Iran has been deprived of these great opportunities. Yet internationally, Mesha Amini’s hashtag has appeared 180m times on Twitter. “We stay in touch with home mainly by texting, which they are able to connect with a very, very low speed at some points of the day using VPNs. Sometimes, you go days without being able to speak to your family. We have our closest friends who are risking their lives on the streets facing armed forces. Many of them got shot with blank bullets and beaten up with truncheons mostly within the first days, but after two to three days most of the oppressing forces have been using lethal weapons. So every single day we wake up and the first thing that we do is to somehow make sure that our families and friends are safe and not arrested.” Barbob M “Bodies are being buried in silence. My friend told me that they have killed four men on the streets and they’re refusing to deliver their bodies to their parents. They use children as soldiers and ambulances to arrest protesters. “Their secret service agents are functioning in literally every foreign city that there are protests in. If you have followed the news, police in London, Milan, Frankfurt, and many other cities have arrested their spies while they were trying to take pictures and films of the protesters so they can open a legal prosecution against them in Iran. We also have been threatened while we were trying to organise a demonstration in the city we are living in. This is the exact quotation of the spy on WhatsApp: ‘I know ur your faces and names, all of you are going to be reported. Say bye to Iran.’”\nZahra H on being stopped by the morality police “They told me that my clothes are too short and tried to take me. When they found out I was 15, they let me go. The streets were empty and I was alone. After that, I was scared of anyone with a black veil who approached me in the streets. I never felt safe. “One time they stopped me and my friends biking our way to a coffee shop to have breakfast at 8am. They took our bikes and said we should retrieve them from a parking lot far away in exchange for money. They took our IDs and made us sign a form declaring we won’t do this again. When a friend of mine refused to do so, they used force to make her do it. One other time they took us by a van to the Vozara building [the facility where Mahsa Amini was taken] after stopping me and my classmate for improper hijab. They made us hold up a plaque with our credentials on it and took our pictures like criminals. “Their behaviour was very rude and hostile. They pushed us, threatened us by saying words like, ‘You can’t go to university any more if we catch you one more time’, and spoke to us in a very harsh manner. I was shaking the whole time. I felt like I was violated. I was never able to hang out with my male friends in public because if they would have seen us, my male friend would have been taken. I always feel like my teenage years have been stolen from me.” Sadaf B “For a long time, the majority of people used to believe that this regime can be reformed in good ways and used to vote for every election, although it is now realised that all of them were preselected. But in the past decade, people have come to an understanding that this devil regime is not to be reformed, but to be changed.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-10-02T21:15:16Z'}, {'id': '633a552e8f0883d28b586b0b', 'bodyTextSummary': 'That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan – thanks for following along.

You don’t have the right to do this to the working class,” Castro told the Brazilian during a trip to Havana, according to Morais’s bestselling biography. “Get back into politics!” Lula’s chronicler believes it was a pivotal moment in the life of his 76-year-old subject, who took his Cuban host’s advice to heart.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-10-02T22:16:42Z'}, {'id': '633a0ccb8f08ec87f1106c18', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Some sharp-eyed readers have pointed out that int he screenshot I posted of the results, lula’s name has been replaced with the word “squid” (the word “Lula” means squid in Portuguese).

Thanks to the efforts of Bruno Pereira, the Indigenous expert slain this year alongside British journalist Dom Phillips, collecting votes in Amazonas’ remote Javari Valley region is less fraught than in recent years. Villages in the Javari Valley territory received their first voting centers in 2014. To deliver a voting machine to the most distant village, Vida Nova, election officials usually fly in a small plane from Manaus to Cruzeiro do Sul, a city in Acre state. There, they board a helicopter for the final leg. It is a 1,000-mile round-trip voyage to reach a place with 327 voters, in a nation with an electorate of more than 150 million people.\nUntil 2012, the region’s only voting centres were in the city of Atalaia do Norte. That year, a mayoral candidate distributed gasoline to about 1,200 Indigenous people from the Javari Valley Indigenous Territory so they could make the multi-day trip downriver to vote. The candidate hadn’t provided enough fuel for their return trip, however. They were stranded on the riverbanks for weeks without proper sanitation, prompting a rotavirus outbreak. Five Kanamari babies died and some 100 people were hospitalised. At the time, Pereira led the local bureau of Brazil’s agency for Indigenous affairs.

Tucker was diagnosed with terminal cancer two years ago, and has been under Hospice Taranaki’s care. “I call them angels in the night,” Tucker said of the staff, who have attended to him at all hours. When he learned of the hospice’s financial difficulties, he decided to act.\nTucker called all the photographers he knew to see if they would provide their best shots. “The whole thing took off,” he said. “For the first time ever in New Zealand, it brought all of our journalists together.” “They tend to be very competitive.

The body of Paul Urey, a British aid volunteer who died after being captured by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine has been returned to the UK. Urey’s family raised £9,000 to repatriate his body after the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was unable to pay the transport costs. Ukrainian forces have shot down 8 Iranian-made kamikaze drones on Sunday, the Kyiv Independent. According to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Ukraine’s air force also carried our four strikes that hit two Russian weapon stockpiles, as well as two anti-aircraft missile systems. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said that he believes Ukraine is “making progress” in the war. In a CNN interview that aired on Sunday, Austin attributes the changing tide of war to the calibre of Ukrainian soldiers and their use of weapons provided to them by the US and NATO countries. Ukraine is starting to believe it can take back Crimea, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s top representative in the region. While there’s no suggestion that Ukraine is close to being in a position to regain the annexed region, Tamila Tasheva and her team spend their days discussing the logistics of what would happen should Kyiv regain control. The recapture of Lyman is a key factor for “further de-occupation” in the neighbouring Luhansk region, according to its Governor Serhiy Gaidai. The comments, reported by Reuters, come after Ukrainian forces declared full control of a city located in one of the four regions annexed by Vladimir Putin on Friday. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has been discussing the military importance of Lyman, following the news that Russia has lost control of the eastern city. AP reports that the Donetsk city was described as crucial during a daily intelligence briefing on Sunday, owing to its “key road crossing over the Siversky Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defences.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. In a short video clip on his Telegram channel, Zelenskiy thanked serving Ukrainian troops for liberating Lyman. “As of 1230 [Kyiv] local time Lyman is completely cleared,” he said, adding: “Glory to Ukraine.” The nine European countries who issued a statement earlier to condemn Russia’s annexation of Ukraine were all signalling their support for Ukraine to join Nato. AP reports that the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and Slovakia were backing a path for Ukraine’s Nato membership in their slightly opaque joint statement. Ukraine’s capture of Lyman demonstrates that the country is making progress and able to push back against Russian forces, Nato Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has told NBC. “We have seen that they have been able to take a new town, Lyman, and that demonstrates that the Ukrainians are making progress, are able to push back the Russian forces because of the courage, because of their bravery, their skills, but of course also because of the advanced weapons that the United States and other allies are providing,” Reuters reports that Stoltenberg said. A leading charity which has been helping the government with rematching Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts after initial placements end or break down, is to scale back its work because they say the scheme is unworkable. Refugees at Home is one of five voluntary and community organisations listed as “recognised providers” on the gov.uk website to help match and rematch Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts.

The presidents issued a joint statement saying they could not “stay silent in the face of the blatant violation of international law by the Russian Federation”. “We reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” they said. “We do not recognise and will never recognise Russian attempts to annex any Ukrainian territory.” The statement was issued by the presidents of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

Adam Hadley, executive director of Tech Against Terrorism, a London-based initiative supported by the United Nations, said: “Rusich, an openly neo-Nazi group highly likely operating on behalf of the Kremlin, has promoted the commission of war crimes in the conflict. “Despite Putin’s claims, the actions of Rusich in the conflict demonstrate the concerning prominence of neo-Nazi groups committing atrocities on behalf of the Kremlin.” Rusich fighters, known for their brutality in Syria and the 2014 war in Crimea, have been spotted on open sources in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Kherson and in the Kharkiv region.

As it approaches 9.15am in Kyiv, here’s a rundown on the latest news and overnight developments. Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat on Saturday when Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, with videos showing them raising a national flag and performing a victory dance. Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The defeat is an embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, who declared on Friday that the city – in the Donetsk region – was Russia’s “for ever”. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, made a surprise visit to Ukraine – her first since Russia’s invasion in February – as Kyiv urged Berlin to send it battle tanks. Lambrecht visited the southern port city of Odesa on Saturday and met her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, the German defence ministry said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no longer leaking under the Baltic Sea because an equilibrium has been reached between the gas and water pressure, pipeline spokesman Ulrich Lissek told AFP. The British prime minster, Liz Truss, has said the series of explosions that severely damaged Russia’s gas pipelines were an act of sabotage. Belarus is preparing to receive Russian soldiers and equipment, the Kyiv Independent reports. There are about 1,000 Russian soldiers in the country. Ukraine’s ambassador to Canada said her country held Russia to account for violating Ukraine’s sovereign airspace by bombing airports, which goes against the 1944 agreement setting out core principles for global aviation. Yuliya Kovaliv told Reuters it was important that all members of the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) addressed “such a drastic breach of the Chicago convention”. Russia failed to win enough votes for re-election to the ICAO’s governing council. The French representative told the assembly after Saturday’s ballot: “When we have votes in our countries, if we don’t like the result, we don’t ask for another vote.” Russia had a place on the UN aviation agency’s 36-member council as one of the “states of chief importance in air transport”. The head of Russia’s region of Chechnya said Moscow should consider using a low-yield nuclear weapon in Ukraine after its battlefield defeat in Lyman. Ramzan Kadyrov said in a message on Telegram addressing Russia’s loss of its stronghold: “In my personal opinion, more drastic measures should be taken, right up to the declaration of martial law in the border areas and the use of low-yield nuclear weapons.” A superyacht built for an oligarch under sanctions is being discreetly offered for sale for £26m ($29m), with buyers advised that any viewings will be in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Brokers are being warned that the sale of MySky, built for Igor Kesaev – sanctioned over the supply of weapons to the Russian army – should not be advertised online. Russia has accused the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, of violating the game’s principles by suggesting that Russian athletes might be allowed to return to competition provided they did not support the invasion of Ukraine. Bach told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “This war has not been started by the Russian athletes.” Russian authorities informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that the head of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was “temporarily detained” for questioning. Ihor Murashov was detained on his way from the Russian-occupied plant – Europe’s largest – to the town of Enerhodar at about 4pm on Friday. Russia is trying to transfer the Zaporizhzhia plant to the Russian energy firm Rosatom, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, Petro Kotin, has told the BBC. Kharkiv oblast’s governor said Ukrainian authorities found the bodies of at least 20 people in a civilian convoy near the city of Kupiansk. Oleh Syniehubov believed they were killed while they attempted to flee Russian soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Petraeus said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow. He told ABC News: “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato – a collective – effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.” The warning comes days after Putin expressed views that many have interpreted as a threat of a larger war between Russia and the west. Asked if the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine would bring America and Nato into the war, Petraeus said that it would not be a situation triggering the alliance’s Article 5, which calls for a collective defense. That is because Ukraine is not part of Nato – nonetheless, a “US and Nato response” would be in order, Petraeus said. Petraeus acknowledged that the likelihood that radiation would extend to Nato countries under the Article 5 umbrella could perhaps be construed as an attack on a Nato member. “Perhaps you can make that case,” he said. “The other case is that this is so horrific that there has to be a response – it cannot go unanswered.” Yet, Petraeus added, “You don’t want to, again, get into a nuclear escalation here. But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way.” Nonetheless, with pressure mounting on Putin after Ukrainian gains in the east of the country under last week’s annexation declaration and resistance to mobilization efforts within Russia mounting, Petraeus said Moscow’s leader was “desperate”. “The battlefield reality he faces is, I think, irreversible,” he said. “No amount of shambolic mobilization, which is the only way to describe it; no amount of annexation; no amount of even veiled nuclear threats can actually get him out of this particular situation. “At some point there’s going to have to be recognition of that. At some point there’s going to have to be some kind of beginning of negotiations, as [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy has said, will be the ultimate end.” But, Petraeus warned, “It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia. And even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield won’t change this at all.” Still, he added, “You have to take the threat seriously.” Senator Marco Rubio, the ranking Republican member of the Senate foreign relations committee, told CNN that Putin was down to two choices: established defensive lines or withdraw and lose territory. Rubio said he believed it “quite possible” that Putin could strike distribution points where US and allied supplies are entering Ukraine, including inside Poland. The senator acknowledged the nuclear threat, but he said most worries about “a Russian attack inside Nato territory, for example, aiming at the airport in Poland or some other distribution point”. “Nato will have to respond to it,” he said. “How it will respond, I think a lot of it will depend on the nature of the attack and the scale and scope of it.” But as a senator privy to Pentagon briefings, Rubio resisted being drawn on whether he’d seen evidence that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. “Certainly, the risk is probably higher today than it was a month ago,” Rubio said, predicting that Russia would probably take an intermediate step. “He may strike one of these logistical points. And that logistical point may not be inside … Ukraine. To me, that is the area that I focus on the most, because it has a tactical aspect to it. And I think he probably views it as less escalatory. Nato may not.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2022 to correct several misspellings of David Petraeus’s name.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-10-03T13:55:25Z'}, {'id': '6339b17a8f0883d28b58671f', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Brazil’s leftwing former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva appeared on the verge of a startling political comeback on Sunday as more than 156 million Brazilians took part in the country’s most important election in decades. As the veteran ex-president cast his vote in Brazil’s industrial heartlands on Sunday morning, Lula voiced optimism he was heading for victory over the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. “We want no more hatred, no more quarrelling, we want a country that lives in peace,” the 76-year-old told reporters in São Bernardo do Campo, the city where he began his legendary political career as a unionist in the 1970s. Polls on the eve of the election suggested Lula – who governed from 2003 to 2010 – was tantalisingly close to securing the overall majority of votes he needs to avoid a second-round runoff against Bolsonaro in late October. But by late on Sunday the election appeared to be heading for a run-off on October 30, as Bolsonaro’s strong initial showing seemed to have ended Lula’s hopes of a first-round victory. With 70% of votes counted, Lula was ahead with 45.74% compared to Bolsonaro’s 45.51% – although those numbers were expected to change as votes from traditionally pro-Lula regions were tallied.\nA Lula victory would represent the latest in a series of triumphs for a resurgent Latin American left, following the election of leftist leaders in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Chile. “I’m going to win these elections so I can give the people the right to be happy again. The people need, deserve and have the right … to be happy once more,” Lula told journalists as he wrapped up his campaigning with a parade through the streets of São Paulo on Saturday. The prospect of a Lula victory has galvanised leftwing and centrist Brazilians after four years under Bolsonaro during which nearly 700,000 people died of Covid and more than 30 million were plunged into poverty and hunger. “I feel hope,” the former president’s biographer and friend Fernando Morais told the Guardian as he prepared to vote wearing a Jeremy Corbyn T-shirt. “I feel like going out and distributing kisses.” Morais considered Lula’s return to power the only way to tackle the intensifying “social tragedy” that was on full show as the writer drove to the polling station in downtown São Paulo. “When you go out at night around here … only 1km from the homes of bankers and big businessmen, you see people freezing to death,” Morais said as he turned into a square where dozens of emaciated people had taken shelter under filthy blankets and in tents. A giant banner hung over the square by anti-Bolsonaro activists read: “Brazil has gotten worse”. “This didn’t exist 10 years ago … It’s like an improvised refugee camp,” Morais said.\nAcross town near São Paulo’s main avenue, Paulista, Lula supporters flocked to polling stations in T-shirts bearing his name and the star symbol of the Workers’ party (PT) he helped found four decades ago. “Today is a day of hope,” said Eduardo Horderle Peruzzo, a 35-year-old University of São Paulo historian. “We know that this election won’t fix everything. We know this is the beginning of a long path. But we want Brazil to at least be able to dream of the future again.” “So many of the advances that took decades to achieve have been destroyed over the last four years,” said his partner, music teacher Mariana Moga de Moura Silva.\nBolsonaro, a Donald Trump-admiring former army captain, was defiant as he cast his vote in a military neighbourhood on the outskirts of Rio, where he built his political career. “I’m confident from what I’m seeing,” the 67-year-old populist told reporters. But polls suggest more than half of Brazilians now reject Bolsonaro, on whose watch Amazon deforestation has soared to record levels and Brazil has become an international outcast. “I think the end is nigh in the sense that I truly believe Bolsonaro will not win this election,” said Flávia Oliveira, a political commentator from the television channel GloboNews. “Everything in the polls suggests the majority of Brazilian voters no longer support this project, as they did in 2018. This project has lost adhesion and has lost allies precisely because it has failed to improve people’s lives.”\nBolsonaro’s authoritarian inclinations and relentless questioning of Brazil’s electronic voting system have fuelled concerns he may refuse to accept defeat to Lula. Some fear he may seek to incite turmoil similar to the 6 January invasion of the Capitol in the US if his re-election bid fails, or even a military coup. Trump backed Bolsonaro on the eve of Sunday’s vote with a video message to Brazilians. “He’s done an absolutely incredible job,” Trump claimed, calling Bolsonaro “one of the great presidents of any country in the world”. “I have met many leaders but few as exceptional as President Bolsonaro,” Hungary’s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said in a video shared on social media by the Brazilian president. Those declarations further fuelled progressive angst over how Bolsonaro and his radical supporters could behave in the coming hours and days. Asked if he would respect the result of Sunday’s election, Bolsonaro turned his back on reporters and walked away.

Family members of the Warrington man raised £9,000 to repatriate his body after the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it was unable to pay the transport costs. Urey, 45, was captured by pro-Russia separatists along with other British nationals in April after travelling to Donetsk. He had initially planned to join the Ukrainian Foreign Legion, but was rejected on health grounds and became an aid volunteer. Shortly after he was captured at a checkpoint near the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, his family members begged his Russian captors to provide him with the medication he needed to manage his type 1 diabetes. When his death was reported in July, a Russian official, Natalya Nikonorov, blamed “acute coronary insufficiency aggravated by pulmonary and brain edema”. Urey was also in a “depressed psychological state due to indifference to his fate in his homeland”, another official told Russian state media. Despite speculation that his captors had withheld his lifesaving medication, one of the Britons detained with him said he had been given insulin. Dylan Healy also described being tortured, however, and said the pair had endured a mock execution. The 22-year-old told the Mirror: “There was no panic, I was resigned. I didn’t want to cry because it wasn’t going to change it. They shouted at you if you slept. “They waterboarded me. They put me on a table, put a rag in my mouth and poured water in until I was choking. “When I spoke to Paul he said this hadn’t happened to him. They wanted to know how we’d got behind the lines and why, and if we were British spies. “There were regular beatings, every day. They had old-style police batons and my ribs were broken. “The Russians have a love of Tasering, they had these long prongs which they put on your skin. Paul had been Tasered, he said it was easier than he thought it would be.” When Urey’s body was released in September, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, claimed an examination showed “signs of possible unspeakable torture”. Healy, who described his time in captivity as a “harrowing experience” which he did not expect to survive, said Urey had been subjected to another beating two days before he died. “They did something to make him scream for 10, 20 seconds,” he said. “I don’t think I’ll ever hear someone scream like that again. That was the last time I saw Paul alive.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-10-02T18:45:38Z'}, {'id': '6339a0788f08ec87f11068c5', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Just after the match between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya had finished at Kanjuruhan stadium in Malang, East Java, Indonesia, on Saturday night, a group of three Arema fans climbed down from the stands, attempting to meet their team’s players on the pitch, recalled a spectator who was watching from the southern stand. It had been a disappointing game for the home side: they’d lost 3-2 to Persebaya Surabaya – a team they shared such fierce rivalry with that its supporters are banned from Arema’s ground. This was their first loss against Persebaya after 23 years of undefeated home matches. The home fans were perhaps going to use their disappointment at their team’s performance as an excuse to demand selfies, added Prayogi, 29, the owner of a shop that sells football clothes, who asked not to give his full name. At that point, things were still calm, he said. “There was absolutely no tendency to attack Persebaya’s players,” he added. “Their captain even had the time to pray and thank God for their victory in the middle of the field,” he said.\nThe situation escalated, however. The small group of fans who went down seemed to trigger more supporters to leave the stands. Soon tens, hundreds, and even thousands crowded the field. The exact sequence of events is unclear, but social media footage shows police using batons to disperse the crowd, kicking supporters and firing teargas. The teargas – which should not be fired in stadiums, according to Fifa guidance – was used without warning, said three supporters who spoke to the Guardian, including Prayogi.\nThe East Java regional police chief, Insp Gen Nico Afinta, said that the use of teargas was in accordance with police procedure. It was fired because the fans had acted anarchically and entered the field, he said. “If the fans had obeyed the rules, this incident would not have happened,” said Afinta. Zhafran Nashir, 17, a student who had been watching the match with his brother from the eastern stand, said the use of the gas caused panic. He saw teargas fired five times at people waiting in the southern end. “I think it was unnecessary because the riot occurred right on the field,” he said. “Some on the pitch had tried to get into the players’ locker room, but people on the stands were just watching. When teargas was fired, everyone in the stands rushed to leave. People were being trampled on, he said. His stand was also fired at. When he tried to escape, he saw two children who had lost their parents in the chaos.\nPrayogi, who was watching near gate 13 with his wife and friends, decided to stay put until the situation had calmed down. “I held out in the stands even as the gas strangled my throat,” he said. “In my 20 years as an [Arema fan], I have never felt as terrified as I did that night.” Fans were stuck in a deadly crush at the nearby exit. “The door leading to the exit gate was only two to three metres wide,” Prayogi said, adding that he believes it was locked. The Guardian is unable to confirm this. “The fans were forced to break it down just to leave the field. I think a lot of people were trapped in those halls, packed tightly enough that many of them broke their bones, or fell unconscious after they ran out of breath.” Officials said 125 people were killed in the disaster and 320 injured.\nRahmat, 23, had been watching from the north side, along with seven of his friends. His stand was also targeted with teargas; his eyes teared up and he felt short of breath. “The police did not warn us before they fired teargas at us. So when the crowd broke, it was full of panicked and suffocating people with burning eyes,” he said. “The sound of shots ringing out was so deafening. When I first saw the mob and the chaos around me, I thought that my life would end tonight, that I would surely die here.” Rahmat echoed reports the stadium was filled beyond its capacity. “Some of the audience didn’t even get a seat,” he said.\nHe waited between 30 minutes and an hour before trying to leave, by which time things had calmed inside the stadium, but the chaos had expanded to the streets. “The first thing I saw after I left the stadium was people lying on the ground. I thought they were just drunk or unconscious. But after I got home, I realised that what I saw then were corpses,” Rahmet said. He saw two police cars that had been set on fire, and another two cars that had been smashed by fans. Near the exit a raging fire soared high up into the sky. An official who works for Persebaya, and who first helped evacuate players and managerial staff, said his vehicle was later stoned and torched by Arema fans as he tried to leave the stadium.\n“My face was bruised, and we barely escaped being burned alive that night,” said Defri Hariyanto, 30. Within only 20 minutes, the police truck I rode in was set alight by an angry mob. I thought I was going to die.” He was too traumatised to speak at length about his experience, he said. All interviewees said they had never witnessed such brutal violence before. “I can never forget what happened last night,” said Prayogi. “The most painful and terrifying part of all this was opening one body bag at a time to see if I could recognise any friends or family.” Prayogi added: “Last night, it felt like a human life had no value.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-10-02T17:10:55Z'}]}
