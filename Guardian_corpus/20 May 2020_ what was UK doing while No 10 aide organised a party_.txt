The police are now investigating. Boris Johnson has ordered officials to examine plans to cut Covid isolation to five days in England as scientists urged caution over the lack of evidence to support a change. NHS England has struck a deal with private healthcare providers under which their hospitals will be ready to start treating NHS patients who cannot get the Covid or non-Covid care they need because their local NHS hospital is under too much pressure. Pfizer Inc chief executive Albert Bourla said on Monday that moving toward a redesigned Covid-19 vaccine that is specifically targeted to combat the Omicron variant is the “most likely scenario.” The small number of people in Italy’s population who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 are largely responsible for the continued health crisis, prime minister Mario Draghi said on Monday. In the US, a new record has been set for the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid-19, with 132,646 currently on wards, according to Reuters. The latest figure, which comes as the highly contagious Omicron strain spreads across the country, surpassed the record of 132,051 set in January last year. Moderna has announced it expects record sales of about $18.5bn (£13.6bn) in contracts for its Covid vaccine in 2022. Novak Djokovic’s brother reportedly ended a press conference after questions about why the tennis ace appeared in public in Belgrade a day after he had tested positive for Covid-19. Emmanuel Macron has condemned protesters on the French overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon who pelted an MP with seaweed and dirt during a protest against vaccine passes.

Reuters reports: Over the weekend, paramedics in Toronto, Canada’s largest city, said there were briefly no ambulances available to respond to emergencies. The city said about 12.8% of its “essential and critical services” staff were off due to Covid-19 as of Monday. It is not unusual for ambulances to be tied up at any moment, city spokesperson Brad Ross said. But with workers sidelined by Covid-19 and stretched hospitals delaying ambulance offloading, it was becoming more common. Low-priority calls may be put off and some will go to the fire department, he said. Like much of the rest of the world, Canada is swamped by the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Earlier this month Canada broke its previous one-day record for the highest number of people hospitalised with Covid-19, at more than 4,100 nationally. Ontario regional transit operator Metrolinx cut its service by 15% as 20-30% of its staff were off work due to Cocid-19, spokesperson Anne Marie Aikins said.

Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the group, said: My Dad died just four days before this email was sent out; he was only 55 and was a fit and healthy key worker. I’ve missed him every day since. Just like the rest of the country, my family had done everything we could to keep him and others safe during the lockdown. Those days will stay with me for the rest of my life, just like the families of the 353 people that died that day. My family couldn’t even get a hug from our friends. To think that whilst it was happening Boris Johnson was making the ‘most of the weather’ and throwing a party for 100 people, is truly beyond belief. Brady was one of five families involved in the campaign who met the prime minister last September. She added: At the time, everyone would have known that going to a party was wrong, so how can those running the country have thought it was OK? Could there be a more disgraceful example of ‘one rule for them, and another rule for the rest of us’? To make matters worse, in September last year I sat in that same garden, looked the prime minister in the eyes and told him how my dad had died. He told me he had ‘done everything he could’ to protect my Dad, knowing that he had partied in that same spot the very day that Dad’s death certificate was signed.

On Monday, during a visit to Nice, in the south of France, he said the “intolerable” and “unacceptable” incident was part of “an intensification of violence” against elected officials, according to the French news agency AFP. The “passe sanitaire” (health pass) is due to be introduced in Saint Pierre and Miquelon shortly. It requires people to present proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter public spaces like bars. Claireaux had earlier told the broadcaster France Info that he had been waiting for the demonstrators outside his home “so as to talk to them”. “There was a car loaded with seaweed … and people started chucking it at me. It was like being stoned. My wife came out to join me on the front step. I dodged a rock that missed our faces by fivecm,” he said.

The study, which began in September 2020, looked at levels of cross-reactive T-cells generated by previous common colds in 52 household contacts of positive Covid cases shortly after exposure, to see if they went on to develop infection. It found that the 26 who did not develop infection had significantly higher levels of those T-cells than people who did get infected. Imperial did not say how long protection from the T-cells would last. “We found that high levels of pre-existing T-cells, created by the body when infected with other human coronaviruses like the common cold, can protect against Covid-19 infection,” study author Dr Rhia Kundu said.

Under “temporary vaccine exemption”, it allows people to tick a box for “acute major medical illness”, and then the guidelines refer to the Atagi advice document on major medical illnesses that mention having a PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in the past six months. “This is the critical Atagi document ... it is an eminently clear expression by Atagi ... that a valid reason for a temporary exemption for an acute major medical condition ... [includes a] PCR confirmed infection,” Wood said. He says this advice is unremarkable; someone who has recently had Covid-19 has some level of natural immunity from having had Covid-19.

The hearing kicked off at 10am AEST in Melbourne, which was 11pm GMT or 6pm EST. The 34-year-old is being held at a quarantine hotel in Melbourne. Judge Anthony Kelly has noted that the ONLY ground the delegate relied on when deciding to cancel Djokovic’s visa is that: “the presence of its holder in Australia is or may be, or would or might be, a risk to: (i) the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the Australian community”. Djokovic’s counsel Nicholas Wood notes in the request for declaration of vaccination, Djokovic claimed he cannot be vaccinated on medical grounds. When prompted to provide proof, Djokovic uploaded the medical exemption document from the CMO at Tennis Australia.\nKelly said a “matter that has really preoccupied me” is the status attached to the Tennis Australia document, and questions why it was not accepted by the delegate making the decision on the visa: Here, a professor and an eminently qualified physician have produced and provided to the applicant a medical exemption. Further to that, that medical exemption and the basis on which it was given was separately given by a further independent expert specialist panel established by the Victorian state government and that document was in the hands of the delegate. The point I am agitated about is ‘what more could this man have done?’ Wood also accused the Australian government’s delegate of an “utter paucity of evidence” in the section of the notice in which they were required to explain why grounds to cancel the visa exist. Wood argued it is “manifestly incorrect” that the biosecurity determination requires both a declaration of an exemption and evidence of the exemption - only the former is required, Djokovic’s team argues. He also said the Department of Home Affairs, before [Djokovic] left, said Djokovic met the requirements for quarantine-free travel. He’s made the declaration, provided the evidence even though it was not required, and then he received [notice] from the Department of Home Affairs ... saying the application has been assessed and meets the required for quarantine-free travel.” Wood says any reasonable person would have considered he ticked every box.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T02:29:26Z'}, {'id': '61db916d8f0813d917538dfd', 'bodyTextSummary': 'US Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announced she tested positive for Covid-19.

Downing Street is facing calls to ensure that Boris Johnson will be personally interviewed by the Sue Gray inquiry about alleged No 10 gatherings during the first lockdown, after it emerged he may have been present at a “bring your own booze” party that month. Boris Johnson has been warned by a Conservative rebel ringleader he faces a massive revolt from his own MPs if he does not end all coronavirus restrictions this month. Germany will study how reliable rapid antigen tests are in detecting the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said on Sunday. More than 150,000 people have died in the UK from coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Covid should be treated as an endemic virus similar to flu, and ministers should end mass vaccination after the booster campaign, the former chairman of the UK’s vaccine taskforce has said. Lateral flow tests in the UK will remain free, education secretary Nadhim Zahawi insisted amid reports they could be scaled back despite soaring Covid cases. London’s public health chief said the Omicron variant “may have passed its peak” in the UK capital. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals has said he is worried about losing staff when new rules come in requiring them to be vaccinated, BBC News reports.

The CDC on Monday elevated its travel recommendation to “level four: very high” for Canada, telling Americans they should avoid travel to its northern neighbour. The CDC currently lists about 80 destinations worldwide at level four. Canada has long been a popular destinations for Americans but for most of the pandemic, the border between the two countries was closed to all non-essential travel. In November, fully vaccinated travellers were once again permitted to move freely to Canada and Mexico, ending the unprecedented closure. The Canadian government did not immediately comment Monday on the CDC’s warning. Last month, Canada’s government implored residents not to leave the country for non-essential travel.\nDespite a high vaccination rate in Canada and masking requirements in major cities, the recently discovered Omicron variant has nonetheless strained provincial healthcare systems across the country. Hospital and ICU admissions have surged over the last week in Ontario, the most populous province. Testing positivity rates have hovered around 30%, suggesting the virus is far more widespread than the daily tally of cases suggests. In neighbouring Quebec, hospitals are struggling with a shortage of beds and more than 20,000 healthcare workers are off the job due to infection. “We are not only seeing an increase in the number of patients in our hospitals, but we are also seeing that we are losing even more staff every day,” said Christian Dubé, the Quebec health minister, last week, warning the province had not yet reached the peak of infections. Canada, which has 422,017 active cases, also set a record for hospitalizations after the weekly average jumped to 5,259 – the highest of the pandemic.

On 20 May 2020, when the prime minister’s private secretary was inviting colleagues to bring their own booze for socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden to “make the most of this lovely weather”, the rest of the country was in a very different position. There was no mixing indoors, non-essential shops were shut, and pubs and other hospitality businesses remained closed. Such was the strangeness of the times, that people were ecstatically celebrating the reopening of McDonald’s drive-throughs as more than 30 branches trialled a gradual reopening of the fast-food chain.\nThe prime minister had only recently announced a slight relaxing to the lockdown rules – from 13 May 2020, two people from separate households were permitted to meet outside in a public place, such as a park, provided they stayed 2 metres apart. Police forces were actively reminding the public to adhere to the rule, a challenge given 20 May 2020 was the hottest day of the year so far.\nJust two days later, on 22 May 2020, the Guardian published its first exclusive revealing police had spoken to the prime minister’s former adviser, Dominic Cummings, about breaching the government’s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had Covid-19 symptoms. The story prompted an outcry. Guidance allowing the “rule of six” outdoors was not brought in until June 2020 and large gatherings remained banned.\nAll of this was reinforced by the then culture secretary, now Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden, in the daily Downing Street press conference on 20 May. He said: “You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.” But alone, or with your household, “you can now spend time outdoors and exercise as often as you like”. He reminded viewers of the “step one” changes to the rules, which said those who could not work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work. This was all against a backdrop of the ever-rising statistics many have come to know too well. On 20 May 2020, there were 9,953 people in hospital with coronavirus. A further 363 deaths were announced, bringing the total at that point to 35,704. Dowden announced the launch of the Covid Alert Level System, with its five levels each relating to the level of threat posed by the virus. At the time, the country was preparing to move to level 3 from 4. Twenty months later, we’re back in level 4 after the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus. Dowden pushed the government’s latest slogan: “stay alert, control the virus, save lives”. He elaborated on how the public might “stay alert” by working from home if possible, limiting contact with other people, keeping 2 metres apart where possible, washing hands regularly and wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces. Elsewhere, the prime minister was enraging Britain’s foreign healthcare workforce with his refusal to exempt them from an NHS visa surcharge. The next day, in the first major U-turn of his premiership, he announced this would no longer apply, capitulating to mounting anger from campaigners and opposition from members of his own party.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T21:30:52Z'}, {'id': '61dc70898f08d3c1f54ebca8', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Boris Johnson has ordered officials to examine plans to cut Covid isolation to five days in England as scientists urged caution over the lack of evidence to support a change. The prime minister came out on Monday in favour of easing quarantine rules if backed by scientific advice. It is understood that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, is also open to the move if clinicians recommend it. The Cabinet Office has been charged with leading the isolation review with input from public health officials at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and Department of Health and Social Care. Two sources told the Guardian there may be a Covid-O meeting as soon as Thursday to examine any proposed changes. One of the options under consideration is for health and social care workers to have stricter conditions on release from isolation than the general population, it is understood. This would be designed to avoid Covid spreading to vulnerable people in hospitals or care homes and could involve keeping isolation periods at seven to 10 days for that group, requiring more testing or extra PPE. Political pressure has been building for a reduction in isolation after the US cut its quarantine period to five days, although the UK’s system is different in that it requires isolation from the point of symptoms if they occur before a positive test. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, emerged as the first cabinet ministers to back a change if recommended by scientists, with others including Johnson and Javid following suit on Monday. Keir Starmer also said he would back a reduction in the time period if the evidence supported it. It is less than three weeks since isolation was cut from 10 days to seven in England if a person tests negative by lateral flow on days six and seven. It is likely that any move to shorten isolation periods again to five days would have caveats about testing negative and applying to those without symptoms. However, scientists still urged caution over the proposed move. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said that while it was “reasonable” to look at reducing the isolation period to five days he had not seen evidence to back such a change. Convincing data could come from experiments that looked at how well LFTs distinguished between people who were still shedding infectious virus and those who were not, even if they still tested positive on PCR tests, he said. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and a member of the Independent Sage group, said he was willing to be convinced that it was safe to shorten the isolation period but evidence to support the move seemed “elusive”. “The limited available evidence, for example [a] small Japanese study, provides little reassurance, suggesting that a substantial proportion of people infected with Omicron are still infectious at five days,” he said. Openshaw said the study was too small to say that asymptomatic people were not infectious beyond five days. If the isolation time were reduced, McKee said the government was right to consider extra precautions for health and social care workers.\nThe UKHSA estimates that 10-30% of people who self-isolate fafter a positive Covid test are still infectious on day six, dropping to about 5% after day 10. Their modelling suggests a similar risk of being infectious – about 5% – if people end isolation after two negative tests on days six and seven. The work underpins the existing guidance on Covid isolation, but the thinking may change as more data comes in on the Omicron variant. Recent LSHTM modelling showed that requiring two days of negative LFTs to leave isolation reduced the risk of transmission to almost nil as the likelihood of being infectious after a series of negative lateral flow tests was very low.\n“But if we find that most individuals test positive for a longer period, this may not address the staffing crisis as desired,” said Billy Quilty, an infectious disease epidemiologist who worked on the modelling. “We urgently need to know how long people are testing positive by lateral flow for on average, and how well this corresponds to the infectious period for Omicron.” Preliminary findings from Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases hint that people who have asymptomatic Omicron infections may stop shedding the virus sooner than those who have symptoms. That asymptomatic infections are typically cleared faster is not unexpected, but the study includes only 21 cases, so the results are considered tentative.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T20:34:53Z'}, {'id': '61db66f28f08ed5dbdaf5a07', 'bodyTextSummary': 'It took me a long time to embrace my Māori identity. On my mother’s side, I whakapapa (relate, through ancestry) to Kāi Tahu, the largest iwi (tribe) of Te Waipounamu (the South Island of New Zealand), but I grew up believing I was only Pākehā (NZ European). I spent most of my childhood living with my Pākehā father. Even though my Māori ancestry was mentioned occasionally, I resisted the suggestion that I was Māori. I didn’t grow up on a marae (Māori village), or speak te reo – and I didn’t look like the Māori kids I knew. It was only as an adult, with the encouragement of my Gran, on my mother’s side, that I started to explore my Māori heritage. Today, I proudly identify as both Pākehā and Māori. I’ve returned to my marae, and I’m reclaiming my Indigenous language.\nI’ve been supported in this by the aroha (love) of whānau (family) and friends, as well as the writing of thinkers such as Tā Tīmoti Kāretu, who reminds us that if we have Māori ancestry, we’re Māori, and Hana O’Regan, whose work on Kāi Tahu history and identity continues to sustain me. At one point, I had a realisation: we aren’t all “one or the other”. The urge to separate us out is a colonising one, and it has been used to marginalise and exclude people of colour around the world. Challenging binary distinctions – “either/or” – in favour of inclusion – “both … and” – underpins a lot of radical thinking, including feminism and queer theory. “Either/or” doesn’t really work for us here in Aotearoa. For a long time, there has been a tendency to think of New Zealanders as “either Māori or Pākehā” – but many of us are both, and some of us are neither. For example, there are Chinese families who have been here a lot longer than some Pākehā families; and many Chinese New Zealanders are Māori too. Why do I tend to describe myself as “Pākehā”, rather than “NZ European”? Maybe it’s because it was only when I began learning te reo that I really started giving attention to my heritage – including my English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. Also, the word “Pākehā”, being a Māori word, captures a connection to this place that “NZ European” doesn’t. Some people mistakenly believe the word “Pākehā” is an insult, but I think it has mana (honour or prestige). When I think of Pākehā, I think about the people I know who wear the term comfortably. They are, without exception, generous, reflective, and humble. Still, a lot of white New Zealanders reject the term in favour of “NZ European”. I’m not sure why they feel we have to choose. Eschewing the “either/or” mindset allows those of us with European ancestry to embrace both – explicitly acknowledging our European heritage with one, and emphasising our connection to this place with the other. There are those who believe that anyone who rejects the term “Pākehā” is racist, but that isn’t the case. Some New Zealanders who were born in Europe are reluctant to call themselves Pākehā, because it is often taken to mean people whose ancestors settled in Aotearoa. Also, I know people who have European ancestry, but who immigrated to New Zealand from non-European countries (like South Africa) and aren’t sure that the word accurately describes them. Some NZ Europeans may simply feel that a Māori word they struggle to pronounce isn’t the best fit when describing their non-Māori heritage. It’s helpful to remember, though, that reciprocity requires us to extend the same consideration to others. If NZ Europeans think they are being misrepresented when people call them “Pākehā”, I would encourage them to take a moment to think about the many ways Māori have been, and continue to be, “othered” on our own lands. They might also consider the ways they relate – or resist relating – to te ao Māori (the Māori world). As New Zealanders, all of us have a responsibility to learn about, and become familiar with, our country’s Indigenous heritage – whether our ancestors have been here since the beginning, or for 250 years … or if we made the brave journey to Aotearoa ourselves.\n(Learning te reo Māori – even just a bit – is a great place to start!) It’s natural that a discussion about ethnicity should begin with personal identity – but it mustn’t end there. Attending to ethnicity will help us create a better community. It can support us in thinking critically about how power is distributed, and who is unfairly disadvantaged in our society. Ethnicity data helps us to see that our education, health, and criminal justice systems are failing Māori and Pasifika. Recording and monitoring it can assist us in designing and evaluating initiatives that address institutional racism. Likewise, a critical understanding of ethnicity in Aotearoa can challenge the anti-Asian sentiment which has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic. As we continue to explore ethnicity, let’s remember that all of us belong here. We may relate to Aotearoa in diverse ways, but together we can imagine a community in which everyone thrives.

A Ukrainian army officer until two years ago, Tereshchenko is preparing for a possible Russian attack. If Moscow does launch a further military operation against Ukraine, assuming diplomatic talks fail this week, he and his friends are ready to fight, he said. “There are a lot of us. It’s our house, our country,” he pointed out. Tereshchenko conceded that Russia has a formidable army, with 100,000 troops massed on the border. It could swiftly overrun much of Ukraine “in a Blitzkrieg”, he said. But he predicted that should the Kremlin seize new territory it would quickly find itself embroiled in a bloody and costly partisan war. “There will be many Russian casualties,” he anticipated. “The Kremlin can seize runways, demand concessions. But they will find it hard to hold cities. During the day they will see a civilian population. At night we will attack them with weapons and grenades.” As Russia and the US sat down on Monday for talks in Geneva, with Nato-Russia negotiations due to take place on Wednesday, the mood in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was calm. Snow had settled for the first time this winter on the city’s cobbled boulevards and fairytale art nouveau mansions.\nSome people, like Tereshchenko, were following political events keenly. Others were doing their best to avoid them. One local journalist said she had gone on vacation, reasoning that it made sense to take a break now before a possible Russian attack later this month. “Actually I had an exam today. I’m focused on normal life,” said Nikita, a 20-year-old IT student sitting in a downtown coffee bar. “This situation has been going on since 2014. You can’t live under constant pressure. You adapt.” His friend Diana admitted: “I’m trying not to think about it. It’s too much negative. “Yes, the situation with Vladimir Putin is a bit scary. But we have so many other problems in Ukraine, including Covid. To think about one more is hard,” she said, before jumping in an Uber. Others were fatalistic in the face of Kremlin threats. Last summer Putin published an essay in which he asserted Ukraine and Russia were “one people”. He wants Nato to rule out membership for Ukraine and effectively to return eastern Europe to a Russian zone of influence.\nWould there be more war? “What Putin thinks he generally does,” Tatiana, a middle-aged pharmacist, said. “I wouldn’t describe myself at this moment as an optimist.” She added: “Some of the things he has written about history are ridiculous. He twists things for his own purposes. He lies.” Tereshchenko said he had fought in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists run their own mini-fiefdoms from the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. He said there were some “traitors” active in Ukrainian politics, who would be willing to work with Russia in the event of a takeover. Ukraine and Russia are different countries with different traditions – one democratic, the other strongly autocratic and repressive, he said. He reeled off a series of dates, starting with 1648 when Ukrainian Cossacks allied with Crimean Tatars to throw out their Polish overlords. The rebellion led to the creation of a hetmanate, a “democratic system” in which Ukrainians voted for a military chief or hetman. At the same time, eastern Ukraine became part of the Russian empire. Over the next two centuries Ukrainian traditions, culture and language were eroded, he said. Ukrainian statehood was too precious and too hard won to be sacrificed once again to Russian ambitions, he suggested. “There are groups of us in every town. Resistance won’t stop.” Tereshchenko was scathing about the US-Russia discussions taking place in Switzerland. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky was not at the table. “It’s true our leadership is weak. But how can you decide the future of a state without the state present?” he said.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-14T13:07:48Z'}, {'id': '61d80bb78f08b1b302045c1f', 'bodyTextSummary': 'A full invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of pacifying the capital, Kyiv, would result in Vladimir Putin starting a war on a scale not seen since Iraq in 2003 – prompting western experts to question whether a lasting Russian victory could be achieved. Estimates suggest about 100,000 Russian troops are massing near Ukraine’s borders. Yet, experts following the crisis closely say that for an invasion of the whole country that number would need to nearly double again, and would almost certainly involve forces passing through Belarus. Dr Fred Kagan, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said: “This will likely require an invasion on a scale not dissimilar to 2003, somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 troops.” He predicted that a force that size could be in position by the end of January. About 175,000 US and other allied troops were involved in the invasion of Iraq. Is occupation possible? Kagan, who co-authored a series of reports that led to the 2007 US troop surge in Iraq, said the real challenge for Putin was how an almost certainly hostile Ukraine may be held by the Russians if there was an insurgency after the capture of Kyiv. A determined operation would require one counter-insurgent per 20 inhabitants, said Kagan in a paper he co-wrote with other experts from the Institute for the Study of War. That “would suggest a counter-insurgency force requirement on the order of 325,000 personnel” would be needed to hold Kyiv and Ukraine’s major cities in the south and east, they added. Ukraine has an army of 145,000, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS),, but there are also an estimated 300,000 veterans of the low-intensity conflict in the Donbas region of the country that started in 2014. Polling says a third of Ukraine’s citizens would be willing to take up “armed resistance”. Burnt by the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, Russia generally viewed US attempts to hold countries against insurgents as a mistake. “Putin will have studied what happened to the US in Iraq after 2003. The difficulties of dealing with partisan activity keeps my mind open to the possibility that the Russian president does not intend to invade and conquer Ukraine,” Kagan told the Guardian.\nRussia’s advantages Nevertheless, Moscow has overwhelming advantages in terms of an initial invasion, most notably in terms of rocketry and airpower. Ukraine faces potentially terrifying consequences, in an all-out assault, which could shatter a country’s morale and prompt millions to flee west, rather than fight. Rob Lee, a former US marine and fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “Russia has the capacity to devastate Ukraine’s military units from afar with weapons such as Iskander ballistic missiles. We almost never see modern weaponry like this unleashed; it gives Russia the capability to inflict thousands of casualties a day.” A military assault will also have a transformational effect on international opinion. Civilian casualties in considerable numbers are almost certain, amounting to an operation unlike almost any Putin has conducted before, including the war with Ukraine in 2014, where responsibility for military action was denied. Dr Samir Puri, a senior fellow at the IISS, who has previously spent a year as a conflict monitor in Ukraine, said: “It is hard to imagine a full invasion without the use of airpower, but that is such a huge threshold for Russia to cross.” Much has been made about Ukraine’s recent purchase of weapons from the west, but the Javelin antitank missiles have a range of about 1.5 miles (2.5km) and can only delay an mechanised advance. The country has a relatively modest number of Turkish TB2 drones for now, half a dozen or a dozen, tiny compared with Russia’s thousands of tanks, the core of any ground force. Capturing Kyiv Russia also has to decide how to deal with Ukraine’s cities, principally Kyiv, with a population of 3 million, but also Kharkiv in the north-east, with a population of almost 1.5 million. “Urban warfare is hard, it does fearful damage and Russia struggled with it in Aleppo,” Kagan said, citing Putin’s intervention in Syria’s civil war. Speculation about Russia’s plans – based in part on apparent leaks published in the German newspaper Bild – suggests the Kremlin would surround Kharkiv and ultimately Kyiv, cutting off supplies, hoping in a medieval fashion they will surrender. That may be less violent but would still undercut the idea of Russia acting as a unifying force. Nor is encircling Kyiv easy, western analysts say. The key points of the city, including the presidential palace, are to the west of the readily defensible Dneiper River. The first bridges south of the city are 60 miles away; a dam four miles north has turned the stretch of the river that runs to the border with Belarus into a lake. Exploiting Belarus The simplest way across the river is to cross in a safe territory – Belarus to the north. That would require Minsk’s support, which would be highly probable given its recent rapprochement with Moscow. In a speech to mark Orthodox Christmas on 7 January, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country would “do everything” to take back Ukraine. Russian mechanised forces would aim to encircle Kyiv from the west. One route is to cross the Pripet marshes, which freeze in winter, and the Chernobyl area (not deemed a great complication for a modern military able to operate in a radiation zone). An alternative would be to strike from further west in Belarus, such as the Baranovichy training area. A key sign that Russia is ready to act, Kagan said, will be if “Russian mechanised forces deploy to Belarus”. Even if Putin does not invade, a permanent Russian military garrison in Belarus would have advantages to the Kremlin, as an potential threat not just to Ukraine but to the Baltic states to the north. It would “create a large military base that would give Russia air dominance over Nato’s eastern flank”, said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at foreign policy thinktank Chatham House. Putin’s military alternatives The risks inherent in invasion and occupation leave experts such as Dr Taras Kuzio, an associate fellow with the Henry Jackson Society,arguing in a newly released paper that an all-out attack “the least likely” of the military scenarios available to Putin. Instead, the Ukraine expert sees three other options. In the first, Russia simply occupies and annexes the part of the Donbas controlled by separatists, a partial invasion mirroring the 2008 Georgia crisis. That began, Kuzio wrote, after “repeated military provocations” by proxies “led to intervention by Georgian troops”, giving Putin a pretext to respond. A second is to enlarge the occupied territory with a land corridor to previously annexed Crimea, capturing the coastal city of Mariupol. Russia could also seize other key industrial sites and try to degrade Ukraine’s nearby military. “They could take out Turkish TB2 drones and artillery in the Donbas” in an overt, limited campaign designed to weaken Ukraine, said Lee. A final option, said Kuzio, is the “revival of the 2014 ‘New Russia’ project” that would try “to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea”. This would amount to seizing the south, capturing the port of Odessa and perhaps the industrial city of Dnipro. Taking Odessa, population 1 million, would probably require a dramatic air and naval operation, using paratroopers from Crimea followed by marines landing on nearby beaches. Of those options, annexing occupied Donbas would almost certainly be popular in Russia, However, it would be an extremely limited response given the Kremlin’s insistence that its chief goal, as most recently repeated by Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, is “the non-expansion of Nato, the non-accession of Ukraine, Georgia and other countries to the alliance” – raising concerns that a military campaign is probable. “You have to take a step back and ask what Russia’s political goals are,” said Lee. “If Russia wants to force a change in Ukraine’s political orientation, you can see why the Kremlin might look at military options.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T19:13:44Z'}, {'id': '61dc5bcd8f08ad63cf674a30', 'bodyTextSummary': 'The number of Covid patients in hospital in England and Scotland has continued to increase, according to newly reported figures, as the UK reported 142,224 Covid cases on Monday – the first rise in six days.

The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, and his delegation arrived under Swiss police escort at the US diplomatic mission in Geneva for face-to-face talks with Wendy Sherman, the US deputy secretary of state, and her team. The talks adjourned for lunch and then began an afternoon session. The two senior diplomats made only brief eye contact when they posed for photographs beforehand. “The talks promise to be long and substantial,” the Russian diplomatic mission in Geneva tweeted, with a picture of the two lead negotiators standing in front of their national flags. Sherman said “the US will listen to Russia’s concerns and share our own” in an earlier tweet from Geneva.\nSherman and Ryabkov held a working dinner in Geneva on Sunday evening with the top military officials in their delegations before Monday’s formal negotiations to discuss Moscow’s demands. Those demands were set out last month in two draft treaties, one with the US and one with Nato. Much of their content is unacceptable to Washington and the alliance, most importantly a pledge that Ukraine will never be a Nato member. Ryabkov described the conversation at dinner as “difficult but businesslike”. Sherman “stressed the United States’ commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances”, according to a state department account of the dinner. It said she told the Russians that the US would however “welcome genuine progress through diplomacy”. Russia has 100,000 troops positioned near Ukraine and a similar number are primed to be mobilised at short notice, according to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said on Sunday that the week’s diplomacy was a moment of truth for the Russian president. “There are two paths before us,” he told CNN. “There’s a path of dialogue and diplomacy to try to resolve some of these differences and avoid a confrontation. The other path is confrontation and massive consequences for Russia if it renews its aggression on Ukraine. We’re about to test the proposition about which path President Putin’s prepared to take.” The Biden administration insists that sovereign states’ right to apply for Nato membership is not negotiable. Nor are US troop deployments in Europe, administration officials have stressed. They said, however, that Washington would discuss other security guarantees, such as mutual limits on missile deployments and military exercises on the continent. That would fall far short of the comprehensive changes Moscow is demanding.\nFew if any diplomatic observers expect a quick deal to resolve the crisis this week, and the opposite – a complete breakdown – is possible. It should quickly become apparent whether Russia is interested in negotiating over its proposals or whether they were designed to be rejected, creating a pretext for a war that Putin has already decided on. “We’re about to test the proposition of which path President Putin wants to take this week,” Blinken, told the ABC News programme This Week. “And the question really now is whether President Putin will take the path of diplomacy and dialogue or seek confrontation.” “Lower your expectations and then lower them some more,” said Melinda Haring, the deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. “Watch Moscow’s demands in the meetings. If Russia insists that Nato cannot expand ever again, we will know that Moscow is preparing for war in Ukraine, since this is a red line for the west.” Sherman and Ryabkov lead teams of senior diplomats and defence officials. Sherman was accompanied to the Sunday night dinner in Geneva by Lt Gen James Mingus, the joint staff director of operations, Ryabkov by Russia’s deputy defence, Col Gen Aleksandr Fomin. France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, complained on Sunday that the EU was being excluded from the talks, an omission that he said played into Putin’s hands by dividing the west. “Europeans shouldn’t be absent from the negotiation table,” he told the CNEWS TV network. The state department account of the Sunday night dinner said the US would talk about certain bilateral issues with Russia in Geneva, “but will not discuss European security without our European allies and partners”. France and other European states will be represented at the two other rounds of talks over the course of the week.\nThe negotiating teams will move to Brussels on Wednesday for a session of the Nato-Russia Council, in which all 30 alliance members will take part. It will be the first such meeting since 2019 of the council, which was established in 2002 to defuse tensions and build consensus. The next day there will be a meeting in Vienna of the permanent council of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), chaired by Poland. Representatives will be on a more junior, ambassadorial level than the Nato session the previous day. It will, however, be imbued with particular significance because it will include non-Nato European states such as Finland and Sweden, who are contemplating their future in light of Russia’s pressure on Ukraine. Finnish leaders in particular have hinted heavily in the past few days that they might look anew at Nato membership. “We believe that after bilateral talks with the United States and then the Nato format, in this wider forum, some developments are possible,” said Nikodem Rachoń, the spokesperson for the Polish embassy in Washington. The OSCE talks are the only negotiations in which Ukraine will take part, though its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced a parallel bilateral diplomatic initiative directly with Moscow last month. Washington says the US-Russia meeting in Geneva would primarily be an opportunity to present positions rather than resolve them. “I don’t think we’re going to see any breakthroughs next week. We’re going to listen to their concerns; they’ll listen to our concerns, and we’ll see if there are grounds for progress,” Blinken said. “But to make actual progress, it’s very hard to see that happening when there’s an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine, with 100,000 troops near its borders, [and] the possibility of doubling that in very short order. So, if we’re seeing de-escalation, if we’re seeing a reduction in tensions, that is the kind of environment in which we could make real progress.”\nIn Geneva, Sherman will also list the costs to Russia if it goes ahead with military action in Ukraine, including sweeping financial sanctions, possibly cutting it off from the international electronic payments system Swift, and limits on its citizens’ ability to buy western technology. According to the New York Times, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, has also warned his Russian counterpart, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that an invasion would face a long insurgency, backed by advanced US weaponry. US officials have refused to comment on reports that Stinger anti-aircraft missiles were being sent to Ukraine in anticipation of such a guerrilla war. “This week’s diplomacy is critical. From a certain moment it was clear that the west would not say an outright no to Moscow’s proposal because too much was at stake. The question was, how far Washington and Europeans are ready to go with the talks,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior research fellow at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Russia’s rushed military intervention in Kazakhstan has thrown another wildcard on to the table, but Baklitskiy does not expect it to have any impact on the Ukraine crisis. “There is no direct link between Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Even the people handling the issue in Russia are different, except for the very top,” he said. Others say it is too early to tell whether the uprising and the response will unnerve or embolden the Kremlin. “To what extent are the Russians worried about Kazakhstan or believe they can manage it? I don’t think we have a feel for that yet,” one European diplomat said. If there is wriggle room at all in this week’s negotiations, it could come in one of a handful of categories. The Biden administration and Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, have ruled out bowing to Russian demands to preclude Ukraine’s membership of the alliance, but some analysts say that leaves open the possibility of a compromise, in which the theoretical possibility of membership is asserted at the same time as a clear statement that there would be many obstacles to overcome and so it would not happen in the near future.\nThat may be palatable in Washington and Nato capitals, but it may well not be enough for Putin. “Frankly, I’d be surprised if it was,” the European diplomat said. “Given their demands, I think they prefer to have the issue not addressed at all. Otherwise it shows they haven’t got their demand about Ukraine not joining Nato written down.” US officials have repeatedly denied reports that Washington would negotiate on troop deployments in Europe but said they were willing to discuss reciprocal limits on missile deployments and military exercises. “Russia has said it feels threatened by the prospect of offensive missile systems being placed in Ukraine. As President Biden told President Putin, the United States has no intention of doing that. So, this is one area where we may be able to reach an understanding if Russia is willing to make a reciprocal commitment,” the senior US administration official said. Blinken said the US was also open to talking about limits on missiles previously banned by the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, from which the Trump administration withdrew in 2019 following longstanding US complaints of Russian violations. “There may be grounds for renewing that,” Blinken said, adding that there could also be limits on war games. “There are agreements on the deployment of conventional forces in Europe, things like the scope and scale of exercises that if adhered to reciprocally – that is, Russia makes good on its commitments, which it’s repeatedly violated – then there are grounds for reducing tensions, creating greater transparency, creating greater confidence,” he said. “All of which would address concerns that Russia purports to have.” Missiles and war games are both areas where Russia has called for limits, albeit only on the US and Nato’s activities. It is an open question whether Putin would be satisfied with deals in these areas without some radical change in Ukraine’s status.\n“Putin could go back and say we’ve been assured that there’s no imminent admission of Ukraine to Nato and we have assurances there will be no strike weapons – combat aircraft, missiles – or US bases in Ukraine,” said Rajan Menon, a political scientist at the City University of New York. “But will Russians insist that this be put in writing? That’s the sticky part.” The most severe limiting factor in the negotiations could turn out to be the political constraints on the main parties. “If you look at the polarisation here, it suggests that we have no bandwidth on the US side to actually do anything, sue for peace, let alone come up with a treaty or series of treaties,” said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the US national security council. “Putin has his own time frame of elections in 2024, and he wants to have something to show because his own popularity is lagging somewhat.” The deployment of so many troops and the Kremlin’s rhetoric have set high Russian expectations of what would constitute a satisfactory outcome from the week’s diplomacy. Officials in Moscow have insisted that nothing short of “legally formulated guarantees of security” would be enough to pull back the troops from the Ukrainian border. “Putin has put himself in a position where he has to come back with something, without looking really weak,” Menon said. “Given the political realities now, am I confident that a deal is going to happen? No, not at all. I think it’s going to be very, very dicey.”', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T16:58:46Z'}, {'id': '61dbfbd68f08ed5dbdaf5f4b', 'bodyTextSummary': 'Venezuela’s opposition has claimed a rare and highly symbolic victory over Nicolás Maduro’s regime after defeating the government candidate for the governorship of Hugo Chávez’s home state of Barinas. Maduro had hoped his former foreign minister Jorge Arreaza would win control of the region, which is considered the cradle of Chávez’s “Bolivarian revolution”, in Sunday’s election. The south-western state, where Venezuela’s late president was born and raised, has been governed almost exclusively by relatives of Chávez – his father and two brothers – since he was first elected in 1998. However, Arreaza, who is Chávez’s former son-in-law and the father of his grandson, admitted on Sunday night that his bid had failed despite the Socialist party’s “heroic militancy”. Electoral authorities said the little-known victor, Sergio Garrido, had secured 55.4% of votes compared with Arreaza’s 41.3%. “The triumph is for Barinas and all of Venezuela,” Garrido told Reuters. Jubilant supporters streamed through the state capital on motorbikes and gathered at the politician’s campaign headquarters to perform Venezuela’s national anthem, a song that celebrates “the brave people who shook off the yoke”. “Beautiful Barinas – it ends where it began,” tweeted Juan Guaidó, the leader of the failed US-backed campaign to topple Maduro. Henrique Capriles, another key opposition leader, also painted the result as a harbinger of wider change and urged opponents of Maduro, who took power after Chávez’s death in 2013, to unite ahead of presidential elections in 2024. “Only the unity of the people and the solidarity of its leaders guarantee the greatness of nations,” tweeted Capriles, quoting Andrés Bello, the Venezuelan philosopher who taught Simón Bolívar, the independence hero from whom Chávez sought inspiration. Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, called the result a massive blow for Maduro’s unpopular administration. “This is not just any state. This is the rural heartland of Chavismo where Chávez himself was born and where his family ruled for over two decades. So, symbolically this is enormously important,” Gunson said. Sunday’s ballot was a re-run of a vote first held last November as part of a nationwide round of gubernatorial and mayoral elections designed to help Maduro regain international legitimacy. In that contest – the first that Venezuela’s mainstream opposition had joined since 2017 – Maduro’s candidates prevailed, winning 19 of 23 governorships. The opposition won three. However, the Barinas election descended into farce after Venezuela’s pro-government supreme court disqualified the politician seemingly poised to defeat the official candidate – Chávez’s brother, Argenis – and ordered another election on 9 January. Argenis Chávez withdrew from the re-run and was replaced by Arreaza, a party heavyweight, as Maduro’s administration battled to ensure victory. “Not only did the government blatantly overturn a legitimate result in November but they then poured everything into Barinas,” Gunson said. “They made sure there was petrol at the filling stations. They were handing out fridges and cookers and cement and doing all the things that they haven’t done in the last 22 years – and they absolutely, totally failed.” Like much of Venezuela, Barinas has been brought to its knees by a crippling economic collapse that has driven an estimated 6 million citizens to flee abroad. The agricultural region has also seen growing opposition to Chavismo, the political movement it helped spawn, although some affection for the late comandante, if not Maduro, remains. During a 2018 visit to Sabaneta, the town where Chávez was born in 1954, the Guardian found a charred statue of him that had been torched by anti-government protesters. One local composer-turned-dissident performed a song denouncing Chávez’s “malignant legacy”. “From here in Barinas, I want to ask my Venezuela for forgiveness. Because … it was here that the disaster began, it was here that the comandante who destroyed my nation was born,” it said.', 'lastModifiedDate': '2022-01-10T14:35:28Z'}]}
